## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me practice creating well-structured content with proper semantic HTML. I focused on organizing recipe information clearly with sections for ingredients, instructions, and nutrition facts.

```html
<section class="ingredients">
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  </ul>
</section>
```
