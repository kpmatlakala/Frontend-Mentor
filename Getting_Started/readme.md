A personal portfolio page that integrates all components:

QR Code Component â†’ Link to your resume/contact card

Blog Preview Card â†’ Showcase your latest blog post

Social Links Profile â†’ Your social media connections

Recipe Page â†’ "Recipe for Success" or coding tutorials styled as recipes

ðŸŽ¯ Option 2: "Cooking Community App"
A cooking-focused app:

Recipe Page â†’ Main featured recipe

Blog Preview Card â†’ Cooking tips blog post

Social Links Profile â†’ Chef's social media

ðŸŽ¯ Option 3: "Learning Dashboard"
An educational dashboard:
