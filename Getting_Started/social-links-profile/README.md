### What I learned

This project helped me practice creating a clean, centered layout with smooth hover interactions. I focused on making the social links accessible and visually appealing.

```css
.social-link:hover {
  background-color: var(--hover-color);
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
