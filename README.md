## Frontend Mentor Challenges

Welcome to my **Frontend Mentor Challenges** repository!  
This repo contains my personal solutions to challenges provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), a platform that helps developers improve their front-end coding skills by building real projects.

Each challenge is organized into its own Git branch, following best practices and using semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and accessibility principles.

## 🔀 Branch Structure

Each challenge is stored in a separate branch named after the project.  
To explore a specific challenge:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout recipe-page
📁 What's Inside
Each branch typically includes:

index.html – the main HTML file

style.css – the custom styles following the design system

README.md – challenge-specific details (brief, tools used, live link)

images/ – any assets provided by Frontend Mentor

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5 & CSS3

Responsive Layouts (mobile-first)

Accessibility (WCAG principles)

Vanilla JS (in relevant challenges)

Git for version control

Optionally: React, Tailwind, etc. (for advanced challenges)
