# Frontend Mentor - Typing Speed Test

![Design preview for the Typing Speed Test coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this typing speed test app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We store the passage data in a local `data.json` file. You can use that to randomly select passages of varying difficulty.

## My Solution

### Features Implemented

#### Test Controls

- Start a test by clicking the start button or by clicking the passage and typing
- Select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) for passages of varying complexity
- Switch between "Timed (60s)" mode and "Passage" mode
- Restart at any time to get a new random passage from the selected difficulty

#### Typing Experience

- See real-time WPM, accuracy, and time stats while typing
- Visual feedback showing correct characters (green), errors (red/underlined), and cursor position
- Correct mistakes with backspace (original errors still count against accuracy)

#### Results & Progress

- View results showing WPM, accuracy, and characters (correct/incorrect) after completing a test
- "Test Complete!" message with encouragement to beat your high score
- Personal best persistence via localStorage

#### UI & Responsiveness

- Responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Clean, modern interface with hover and focus states
- Dark theme with accent colors for difficulty levels

### Tech Stack

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (CSS Variables)
- Flexbox for layout
- Vanilla JavaScript for functionality
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project.
4. Structure your content with HTML.
5. Write out the base styles for your project.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
